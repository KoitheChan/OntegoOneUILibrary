# OntegoOne UI Library - Flutterbook

By Christian Joseph and Janet Gloria - 2023
**Welcome to OntegoOne's UI Library, powered by Flutterbook**, a new framework created by [MOONSDONTBURN on GitHub](https://github.com/GhostWalker562/flutterbook) in a mission to re-create React's "Storybook" UI Library framework for Flutter.

# How to Run

- **Make sure Flutter is downloaded on your system** to run the app. The app was developed on Flutter version 3.7.7.
- **Download the Master File** from [GitHub](https://github.com/KoitheChan) either by downloading the Zip File or using Git.
*- If you downloaded the Zip file, make sure to put it in a new, empty folder, and extract it inside that folder for ease of access.* 
However, **it is also possible to clone directly from BitBucket.**
- **Open the folder with the files** in your favourite IDE. 
- Open the terminal, and change directories to where `main.dart` is. **From `flutterbook-master`, you can change to `master`** by inputting `cd master` in the terminal. After that, **change to `lib` by inputting `cd lib`** in the same terminal. At the end, **your directory should be `..../OntegoOneUILibrary/flutterbook-master/master/lib>.`** If the texts are the same, then the correct directory has been selected.
- **Input `flutter pub get`** to make sure all the dependencies needed to run the app have been downloaded. 
- After the dependencies have been downloaded, the app can be **run by inputting `flutter run` into the terminal.**
- **On Windows, you can choose where you want to run the app.** You can choose Chrome, Edge, and other devices that supports running Flutter applications by inputting a number that has been assigned to a device. 
- **On MacOS,** after a device has been connected to Android Studio, **it should run directly on the emulator or Safari.**
